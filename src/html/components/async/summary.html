      Depending on the input, this can result in using a lot of processing power and time.
      The whole process would take approximately 5 seconds to return a result to the
      client. Keep in mind we’re talking about 1 item, a contact from a contact book.
      After a while, a new requirement is added. Solution must support companies that
      manage their contacts organized in files. We agreed to develop a web application
      that would support upload of dataset files, like .csv. The new web application
      should support third party integrations. Some of them are the ESP/CRM services, like
      Mailchimp. User does not need to see the result immediately. System can later notify
      the user about the result, when the process finishes. This information is the key
      that we need to leverage on when developing our solution. So here’s how we did it.
